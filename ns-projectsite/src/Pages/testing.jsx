                            We used the <span className="code-pink">Cypress</span> JavaScript library to create automated integration testing of NudgeShare. This included the testing of separate parts of the app such as login, password changes, creating recordings and sharing recordings as well as integration testing of all functionalities together in different flows. We used <span className="code-pink">Istanbul[1]</span>, a JavaScript code coverage tool, to instrument our code and complete code coverage of our Cypress tests in which we achieved <span className="code-pink">90.26%</span> coverage of the code base.
                            The main goal of this testing was to rigorously test the React app and its rendering of components correctly in an automated fashion. The code passed all test and had excellent code coverage too. This is a good indicator to the performance of the application as Cypress performs all test using a simulated broswer.

                            One of the main goals of this project was to create a responsive product for all devices. We tested the functionality and responsiveness of the deployed application on a range of devices ourselves to ensure that all elements are visible and/or accessible.

                        <p className="my-2">From our manual testing, the app performs correctly on all platforms, with no difference in functionality and accessibility between devices and screen sizes. Smaller devices do require scrolling to access certain elements, and this is always achievable by swiping on mobile devices.

                            We tested our application on a range of popular browsers and mobile devices to see its range of compatibility.  The key functionalities of the application were tested on each platform to ensure that they work as intended. Combined with our responsive design testing, it is clear that the application is fit for purpose as a cross-platform service.

                            Overall, the feedback we received was positive, however, it did outline certain issues with the app and its user experience. For example, it was not clear to all of the users that the share agreement must be completed before analysis can be performed, which is a potential future improvement that can be made in the form of a prompt or message to the user.
                            Out take from the user testing was positive overall, and we were happy that the users found the application more than usable in a real world scenario with no major bugs.

                            The main performance feature of the application is the analysis of recordings which includes generating a word cloud and transcription from the legacy back-end code which uses the IBM Watson API. To test this, we measured how long it took for the application to mark the analysis of different length recordings as completed, from the moment the recording is shared. The recordings were taken as snippets of recorded conversation and were different for every single test. These were the results of our testing:

                        </p>
                        <div class="mx-auto mb-3 card w-8/12 bg-base-100 shadow-xl">

                        </div>
                        <p className='my-2'>
                            The total average of the time taken to get the analysis compared to the length of the original recording is 65%, which we feel is acceptable for users who decide to share recordings regularly. We are limited by the speed of the IBM Watson API, which is not the fastest of speech to text services [2], but it is clear that our application is not a bottleneck in this situation.
